# Evade-The-Creeps
Essentially, on a whim, I decided to learn to use the SDL library. And I needed a small project to start out with.

This is an SDL remake of the Dodge The Creeps game that is introduced in the official Godot Engine documentation. I'm still a little inexperienced, so there are definitely some optimisation failures in the code, but overall it's something I'm happy with.

The original assets for the demo game are reused here in the interest of authenticity. The MIT licences of both the Dodge The Creeps game and its assets, as well as the Godot demo projects repository are attached in LICENCE.md.

Thanks for viewing this!
